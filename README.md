# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This project implements **image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. 
The model is trained to classify images into 10 categories: 

- Airplane  
- Automobile  
- Bird  
- Cat  
- Deer  
- Dog  
- Frog  
- Horse  
- Ship  
- Truck

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of CIFAR-10 dataset (normalization, reshaping).  
- CNN model built using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
- Training and validation with accuracy/loss visualization.  
- Evaluation of model performance on test data.  
- Plotting training graphs and confusion matrix.
